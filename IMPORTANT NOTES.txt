POSTGRES
for this course has been created:
-DATABASE named dragonstacknewdb
-DATABASE USER for dragonstacknewdb, named 'node_user_new', with password 'node_new_password'.
and one new user on psql level
-psql user 'dragon_user' with password 'dragon_password'. this is a superuser role.

2. access postgres commandline interface by typing: 
psql -U [name_of_the_user] // in this case: psql -U dragon_user

this will prompt you to enter password, and password is 'dragon_password'

after that, you are entering postgres commandline interface

3. check users table:
SELECT * FROM pg_user;
